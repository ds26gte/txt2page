```
blank lines separate grafs

lines with leading spaces aren't broken (as in troff)

# section title
## subsection title
### subsubsection title
#### and so on
#####
######
 (compat with gfm, pandoc)

# title #
 (this becomes document title (usu centered))

# html-title ##
 (this produces external title only)

.TH single_word_title
.TH "multiword title"
  (this is for compat with man)

.SH section title
.SS subsection title
  (compat with man)

5 or more hyphens -- horiz rule
  (compat with gfm, pandoc)

.** for section break (no title) with ornament

 ``` opens and closes code listing
 ```alpha opens Lisp code listing
     (this requires lisphilite, which should be placed in PATH --
     use lisphilte to softlink to either lisphilite.lisp or
     lisphilite.rkt, which are provided)
   (compat with gfm pandoc)
.EE ... EX also enclose listing (compat with man)

`...` for inline code fragment
``...`` ditto (to include `)
   (compat with gfm pandoc)

* followed by space -- bulleted graf
   (compat with gfm pandoc)

URLs as is
*text* URL
  links to URL with text (with * shorn) as link-text
[text](URL)
  as in GFM

./filename
  links to filename in current directory
./path/name
  links to path/name

@twitterhandle
  links to https://twitter.com/twitterhandle

:emoji:
  image of emoji (see emoji-cheat-sheet.com)

quotes are smart
two hyphens become em-dash unless they're obviously not
  (e.g. i-- --version)

.NAV next_page
.NAV prev_page next_page
.NAV prev_page next_page ToC_page
.NAV prev_page next_page ToC_page index_page
  navigation bar (if -s option not used)
  if any of the .NAV args aren't relevant, use _ as placeholder
    so nav bars on related pages don't jerk about
  you can put .NAV (or anything) relevant to filename.txt
    in filename__something.txt, which will be sourced first

  .so filename
  inserts filename's contents
  .so filename link-text
  links to filename (if -s option not used)

^^[symbol]
  footnote mark in text

:+:
footnote text (can be multiple grafs)
:+:
    (can we make this compat with gfm pandoc, which only supports
    one graf footnotes?)

.!! imgfile
.!! -pos imgfile
.!! -pos imgfile width
   pos is L C or R
   width is percentage (without %)

![alt](imgfile)
   as in GFM

.:= L orem ipsum
  L is set as drop cap

|cell|cell|cell
  on successive lines makes table

for HTML:
  txt2page will use default.css, and if that doesn't exist,
    the lexicographically first .css file in cwd
  this was to avoid markup for specifying CSS
  if you wish to include multiple .css files, simply have your main
    one @import the rest. (@import statments have to be the
    first in a CSS file!)

for PDF:
  set env var GROFF_FONT_FAM GROFF_FONT_BOLD GROFF_FONT_MONO
    to use your neat fonts
```
